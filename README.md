The overall solution is pretty simple

**Tweet Producer** is a Java app which uses the Twitter streaming API to consume tweets and push them to Cassandra cluster on Data Hub

- Itâ€™s a Java app and uses **twitter4j** library to consume the tweet stream
- Applies user defined filter criteria/terms to filter relevant tweets from the stream
- Pushes the tweet data to Cassandra asynchronously
- It provides a REST API to start/stop the app on demand e.g. /tweets/producer

The **Tweet Query service** defines a REST API and interacts with Cassandra to fetch tweet data

- Its a basic **Spring Boot** app which leverages **Spring Data** and Spring Web
- The Cassandra module in Spring Data is used to interact with Cassandra
- `spring-boot-starter-web module` is used to expose a REST API to query tweet related info
